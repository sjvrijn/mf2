- Switched from setup.py to pyproject.toml
-

v2022.06.0

- Added MultiFidelityFunction.x_opt attribute for known optimum of function
- Added warnings in MultiFidelityFunction if not l_bound <= x_opt <= u_bound
- Added callable AdjustableMultiFidelityFunction class to serve as factory
  instead of the previous 'bare' functions

- JOSS paper:
  * Fixed typo
  * Rewrote 'statement of need' paragraphs
  * Improved closing of the paper: how is package used by authors
- Documentation:
  * hardware and software version info now mentioned on performance page
  * example-usage separated out into separate file in docs/scripts
  * figure of example-usage improved to 600dpi
  * page on performance added, script for plots added in docs/scripts, including
    original matlab source code for borehole, currin and park91a/b
